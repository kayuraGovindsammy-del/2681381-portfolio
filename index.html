            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am currently a third year Computer Science student at University of the Witwatersrand, striving to be the best software 
                developer. I am currently learning how to use Git and Github as well as learning new languages such as HTML and CSS. i'm really 
                enjoying this as it is a way to help achieving my goal as a software developer.
            </p>
            <p>
                 I enjoy reading as well as playing games on the Xbox in my spare time. My favourite game to play is Red Dead Redemption 2.
                 My favourite Book series is the Poppy War Trilogy. Additionally, I love watching a lot of movies and listen to alot of music.
                 My favourite movie Grown ups, and my favourite song at the moment is PPP by Beach House.

                Latest Project
            </h3>
            <p>
                My latest project is a simple To-Do list, with features including a choice between a weekly or daily To-Do, 
                the user will be able to click on a day and will be given prompts such as "Priorities", "Extra notes", "Hobbies".
                The user will also be given a motivational quote with every To-Do they make. User's will be able to set reminders for their To-do, and
                each will be colour coded according to how they are priotised. This is a simple wedsite designed to help users be more productive 
                with their schedules.
