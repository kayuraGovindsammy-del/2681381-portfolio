            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am currently a third year Computer Science student at University of the Witwatersrand, striving to be the best software 
                developer. I enjoy reading as well as playing games on the Xbox in my spare time.

                Latest Project
            </h3>
            <p>
                My latest project is a simple To-Do list, with features including a choice between a weekly or daily To-Do, 
                the user will be able to click on a day and will be given prompts such as "Priorities", "Extra notes", "Hobbies".
                The user will also be given a motivational quote with every To-Do they make. User's will be able to set reminders for their To-do, and
                each will be colour coded according to how they are priotised. This is a simple wedsite designed to help users be more productive 
                with their schedules.
