This lab has helped me understand the basics of HTML and how to use simple commands from Git. i've learned how to start a basic web page with just a simple HTML code, as well as making and cloning a repository from Github. Although the git commands felt a bit confusing to use at first, with enough familiarisation, i felt more comfortable to use them. Therefore, after this lab i am now comfortable with using Github to make a repository. I now how to clone repo's and use HTML to make a webpage. I now know how to save and and track files on git, as well as make new branches and merging the branches.
